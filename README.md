GoEuro iOS Test

This is a code test for GoEuro (https://github.com/goeuro/iOS-Test).

Notes:

-An unique startup animation is added and also some custom animation is added in different action.

-The current version of app will work in all iOS version  starting from iOS 7.2 to iOS 9.3.

-The app is fully functional in both online & offline mode.

-All validation and beta testing is done , but due to lack of time unable to provide test case. 

-Date handeling is pretty basic. 

-Some of the utility classes and Models are written in Swift, as you asked :)
Data cache currently works by saving reponses  to a AFNetworking LocalCacheData. It would be nice to store it using Core Data.
