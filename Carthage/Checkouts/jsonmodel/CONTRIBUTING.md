Since JSONModel is becoming more and more popular I need to set some ground rules.

Reporting an issue on GitHub
====================================

------------------------------------

#### What to report?

Be sure you are reporting either 1) a bug you have discovered or 2) a feature request. 

People have been abusing the GitHub issues system for a while to ask all kind of vague questions and I’ve been helping some, but to be honest I just don’t have the time to clarify with the reporting what they need and try to find a solution for each and every case.

Long story short - make sure you are reporting something and not just asking how this or that is done.

#### How to report a problem/request a feature?

1. Describe what you expected to happen.
2. What actually happened instead?
3. Add the piece of JSON relevant to the problem
4. Your Objective-C model code.

I need to be able to **reproduce the problem** in order to fix it.

Of course the best would be if you already have fixed the problem yourself, then create a pull request. If you do - before you send a pull request run ALL TEST CASES on both IOS and OSX! Add a test case for what you have fixed, since it obviously haven’t been covered with one if there was a problem to be fixed.

#### In case you need help with your code/models …

In case you **do need help** with your code: your best start is to **read the repo README**, many people don’t and it really is the best place to find many answers.

In case the README does not answer your question, try StackOverflow. There’s a **hashtag jsonmodel** - search the questions [answered so far](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jsonmodel), and if you don’t find a solution create a new question and give it the tag **jsonmodel**.
